                    <p>It was a beautiful evening for us. That night, we were just complete strangers. Alex joined Jethro’s party lobby in Valorant,
                       and that was the beginning of our story. We played until midnight, our laughter filling the game like background music to something new and special. 
                      When the match ended, we exchanged Discord usernames, a small gesture that felt like the start of something unforgettable
